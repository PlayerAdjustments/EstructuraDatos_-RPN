# EstructuraDatos_-RPN
My profesor made us made a RPN calculator for a project. Very interesting!

I implemented a way to even use negatives when passing Infix operations to be converted and calculated using a Postfix Method!

It may not be the most efficient way, but i think it's creative!

So if you find this, and take on the challenge to optimize this code, be my guest! (It shouldn't be to hard, considering that it has been done before.)

It may be confusing because i made it without reading more than the material my teacher gave me. But you should be fine!
